// Here is where I log all the time spent on my project and what I was doing!

// 05/14/2025 9:00 am - 1:00 am
// This is my first log! I am trying to create a structured codebase progression path so that I can
// come back another time and still understand whats happening.
// I want to start making the foundations, header files, baseline functions, constants and variables that will be used.
// By the end of the session today I will hopefully have a basic remote controller to calibrate the robot.

// 05/26/2025 10:00 pm - 3:00 am
// There have been a few coding sessions since the first that were not logged, this is fine since I decided
// to restructure the whole code base again since I found a more convenient way for smooth motion
// what I plan to do this session is to delete everything that was clutter from before and almost start over
// with much less code, this will make it much easier for me in the future. I plan to remove any gradual movements or anything 
// that is overly complicated for no reason. I am also adding a new helper function file called motorUtilities.

// 05/27/2025 9:00 am - ?
// I have successfully restructured and got rid of a bunch of timing stuff I didn't need.
// I need to tune the timings to maximize swing in the legs to get forward motion.
